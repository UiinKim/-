            "Born in Salzburg, in the Holy Roman Empire, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized.\n",
            "Eine kleine Nachtmusik K. 525, is a 1787 composition for a chamber ensemble by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The German title means \"a little serenade\", though it is often rendered more literally as \"a little night music\". The work is written for an ensemble of 2 violins, viola, cello and double bass, but is often performed by string orchestras.\n",
            "The serenade was completed in Vienna on 10 August 1787, around the time Mozart was working on the second act of his opera Don Giovanni. It is not known why it was composed. Wolfgang Hildesheimer, noting that most of Mozart's serenades were written on commission, suggests that this serenade, too, was a commission, whose origin and first performance were not recorded.\n",
            "The traditionally used name of the work comes from the entry Mozart made for it in his personal catalog, which begins, \"Eine kleine Nacht-Musik\". As Zaslaw and Cowdery point out, Mozart almost certainly was not giving the piece a special title, but only entering in his records that he had completed a little serenade.\n"

            "Born in Salzburg, in the Holy Roman Empire, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized.\n",
            "Eine kleine Nachtmusik K. 525, is a 1787 composition for a chamber ensemble by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The German title means \"a little serenade\", though it is often rendered more literally as \"a little night music\". The work is written for an ensemble of 2 violins, viola, cello and double bass, but is often performed by string orchestras.\n",
            "The serenade was completed in Vienna on 10 August 1787, around the time Mozart was working on the second act of his opera Don Giovanni. It is not known why it was composed. Wolfgang Hildesheimer, noting that most of Mozart's serenades were written on commission, suggests that this serenade, too, was a commission, whose origin and first performance were not recorded.\n",
            "The traditionally used name of the work comes from the entry Mozart made for it in his personal catalog, which begins, \"Eine kleine Nacht-Musik\". As Zaslaw and Cowdery point out, Mozart almost certainly was not giving the piece a special title, but only entering in his records that he had completed a little serenade.\n"
